# Contribution guidelines

We welcome patches to NICE Design System, as long as you follow these
guidelines:

## Coding standards

Follow our ESLint, Prettier and stylelint rules for linting. Run `npm run lint` to check for any linting errors.

If in doubt, follow the format of the surrounding code.

## Documentation

Keep all documentation e.g. comments and readmes up-to-date with any code changes.

## Tests

Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured Jest tests.

## Commit hygiene

Follow [The GDS Way Git style guide](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/git.html) wherever possible.

## Versioning

We release versions from master using [SemVer](http://semver.org/) so your code shouldn't update the version number.

### Breaking changes

Mark any commits with breaking changes so that we can release a major version.
